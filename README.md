# Valorant Composition Builder By: Justin Yang

## ðŸ§  Background Information

Valorant is a competitive 5-on-5 team-based shooter where each match takes place on a specific map, and each player selects one of 27 unique characters called agents. Each agent has a distinct set of abilities that gives them particular roles in the game. To give your team the best chance of victory, you need to assign each teammate an agent so that:
  1) everyone is comfortable playing their chosen agent on the current map, and
  2) all roles are covered as effectively as possible.

My app makes the agent-selection phase simple and easy by allowing players to create profiles that show which agents they can play on each map. Then, the app runs an algorithm that, when given 5 player profiles and a specific map, automatically generates the most optimal team composition.
